2 Methods:
    (A) Directly concatinating 2 buffers

        (1)
        const mergedVideoContent = Buffer.concat([videoContent1, videoContent2]);

        (2)
        saving the created buffer in our local storage

        problem => the downloaded video only shows  the first video

    (B) using ffmpeg library

        (1)
        extrating 2 video links from postman (put error check)

        (2)
        push the data into a stream
